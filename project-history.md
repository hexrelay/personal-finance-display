# Personal Finance Display - Project History

---

## Session 1

**Date:** 2025-12-13

### Summary

Project created. Goal: dedicated Raspberry Pi screen in bedroom displaying personal finance graph.

**Key decisions:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 with full Pi OS, Chromium in kiosk mode
- Elm for frontend, custom-built graph
- Explored bank scraping as data source (Rust prototype created)

**Explored but later abandoned:**
- Bank scraping approach (too fragile, can't capture non-bank data like daily pay)
- Cloud-based architecture with GitHub Actions
- Rust scraper prototype

---

## Session 1.5

**Date:** Between sessions 1 and 2

Pi was set up and kiosk mode confirmed working.

---

## Session 2

**Date:** 2026-01-02

### Architecture Pivot

Realized bank scraping wouldn't capture manually-tracked values (like "I worked today, earned $X"). Pivoted to fully self-contained local system:

**New architecture:**
- Pi hosts everything - no cloud services
- Python backend (stdlib only, no dependencies) serves API and static files
- Elm frontend with graph display (`/`) and data entry form (`/entry`)
- Data stored in local JSON file on Pi
- Entry from any device on local network via `http://<pi-ip>:3000/entry`

**Deployment system:**
- Code built on dev machine, committed to GitHub
- Pi runs deploy watcher (systemd service) checking every 2 seconds
- Frontend checks for code changes every 500ms, auto-reloads when updated

### Files Created

- `frontend/` - Elm app with graph and entry form
- `server/server.py` - Python HTTP server with JSON storage
- `dist/` - Built frontend (committed for Pi to serve directly)
- `pi-setup/` - Install script, systemd services, deploy watcher

### Cleanup

Removed deprecated files from session 1:
- `scraper/` - Rust bank scraping prototype
- `brainstorming.md` - Early exploration notes
- `project-plan.md` - Outdated planning doc

---

## Session 3

**Date:** 2026-01-02

### Rust Backend Migration

Replaced Python backend with Rust for type safety between frontend and backend.

**New stack:**
- Rust/Axum backend with elm_rs for generating Elm types from Rust structs
- Makefile enforcing correct build order (types → frontend → backend)
- Cross-compilation for Pi 4 (aarch64) using `cross` tool
- CLAUDE.md with instructions for future robots

**Key files:**
- `backend/src/types.rs` - Single source of truth for shared types
- `backend/src/main.rs` - Axum server
- `backend/src/generate_elm.rs` - Type generator binary
- `frontend/src/Api/Types.elm` - Auto-generated Elm types (DO NOT EDIT)
- `server` - Cross-compiled ARM64 binary (committed to repo)

**Deployment workflow:**
```bash
make deploy    # Generates types, builds Elm, cross-compiles ARM binary
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push
# Pi auto-pulls and restarts within 2 seconds
```

### Cleanup

- Removed `server/server.py` (replaced by Rust)

---

## Session 4

**Date:** 2026-01-05

### Summary

Major feature development session focusing on the graph visualization and UX improvements.

### Key Changes

**payCashed Logic Fix:**
- Fixed `incomingPayForEntry` algorithm in `Calculations.elm`
- Now correctly checks if ANY entry in current week has `payCashed=true`, then counts only hours from current week (starting Sunday)

**Edit Button:**
- Added edit button next to delete in entry rows
- Clicking populates the form with that row's data for editing (leverages existing upsert behavior)

**elm-ui Refactor:**
- Migrated entire frontend from inline HTML/CSS to `mdgriffith/elm-ui`
- Cleaner layout code with proper Element-based structure

**Credit Limit Field:**
- Added `creditLimit` to Entry type (Rust and Elm)
- New form field between credit available and hours worked

**Graph Implementation (1920x1080 Full HD):**
- SVG-based visualization for Raspberry Pi display
- X-axis: dates from Dec 20 to Jan 31, with weekday+day labels (e.g., "M6")
- Y-axis: dollar amounts in "k" notation ($5k, $10k, etc.), extends below zero for credit
- Green filled bars: checking balance (above x-axis)
- Yellow filled bars: credit drawn (below x-axis, calculated as creditLimit - creditAvailable)
- Cerulean step line: earned money (checking + incoming pay)
- Red step line: personal debt
- End labels on right margin showing current values

**Graph Technical Details:**
- Gap handling: when data points are non-consecutive, extends previous value horizontally to prevent sloping lines
- Step-based rendering: values remain constant until next data point
- No padding/header on graph page (fills entire 1920x1080 display)
- 25 recent entries shown on entry page (up from 5)

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/Graph.elm` - New graph rendering module
- `frontend/src/Main.elm` - elm-ui refactor, edit button, credit limit field
- `frontend/src/Calculations.elm` - payCashed logic fix
- `backend/src/types.rs` - Added creditLimit field
- `frontend/src/Api/Types.elm` - Regenerated via elm_rs

### Deployment

All changes deployed via `make deploy` with ARM64 cross-compilation for Pi.

## Session 5

**Date:** 2026-01-05

### Summary

Polish and styling session. Project reached 1.0 - now running live on bedroom Pi with TV auto-wake in the morning.

### Key Changes

**Graph Polling:**
- Graph page now polls for new data every second (entry page does not poll)
- New entries appear automatically without page reload

**Kiosk Launch Script:**
- Added `pi-setup/launch-kiosk.sh` with Chromium flags to suppress Google background network requests
- Flags: `--disable-background-networking`, `--disable-component-update`, `--disable-sync`, `--disable-translate`, `--no-first-run`

**Graph Styling:**
- Background changed from dark blue (#252542) to medium blue (#6b7aa0)
- Axis/tick marks now black, axis labels dark gray
- Earned money line changed from cerulean to dark blue (#1e40af)
- Debt line changed to stronger red (#dc2626)
- Draw order fixed: data first, then axes, then end labels on top

**Anti-aliasing:**
- Added `shape-rendering="crispEdges"` to SVG for crisp shapes
- Added `text-rendering="optimizeSpeed"` to end labels group for crisp text

**End Labels Improvements:**
- Labels now positioned just right of last data point (not fixed right margin)
- Labels sorted by Y position and pushed down if they would overlap
- Zero-value labels hidden (earned, credit drawn, personal debt)

### Project Status

**1.0 Complete** - Pi running in bedroom, TV turns on before morning alarm.

## Session 6

**Date:** 2026-01-06

### Summary

Bug fixes and deployment reliability improvements.

### Key Changes

**Build Fix:**
- Previous session built Elm to `main.js` instead of `elm.js`, but `index.html` loads `elm.js`
- Clock overlay change was never actually deployed; rebuilt correctly

**Graph Display Adjustments:**
- Start date changed from Dec 20 to Dec 29
- Y-axis max changed from $20k to $15k

**Deployment Delay Fix:**
- Investigated 10+ minute delay between pushing code and seeing updates on Pi
- Root cause: Browser caching `elm.js` without Cache-Control headers
- Fix: Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` header to Rust server
- Added `set-header` feature to tower-http in Cargo.toml
- Future deployments should update within seconds

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/Graph.elm` - Date range and Y-axis constants
- `backend/src/main.rs` - Added SetResponseHeaderLayer for cache control
- `backend/Cargo.toml` - Added set-header feature

---

## Session 7

**Date:** 2026-01-16

### Summary

Feature development session adding daily pay visualization, note annotations, and various fixes/polish.

### Key Changes

**Orange Daily Pay Indicator:**
- Added orange vertical bars showing pay earned each day (behind the blue "earned money" line)
- Properly accounts for Alaska overtime rules: daily (>8hrs) and weekly (>40hrs) at 1.5x rate
- Added tax withholding estimation (25% / 0.75 multiplier)
- Extracted `calculateDailyPay` function in `Calculations.elm` for DRY
- Added comprehensive overtime tests before refactoring

**Note Annotations:**
- Added ability to mark special events on the graph (e.g., bonuses)
- Note field now supports color encoding: `color:text` format (green/blue/red/yellow)
- Entry form has color radio buttons for note color selection
- Graph displays colored dot above blue line with 45° angled black text

**Graph Adjustments:**
- Y-axis range increased from 15k to 20k
- Orange pay indicators use sharp rectangles (not rounded)
- Added warning comment not to change graph dimensions

**Deployment/Infrastructure Fixes:**
- Fixed elm.js vs main.js confusion (Makefile copies to correct filename)
- Fixed `chromium-browser` → `chromium` in launch-kiosk.sh
- Set up SSH access to Pi (port 2222) for debugging
- Added Makefile principle to practices-and-principles.md

**Weather Display:**
- Changed format from separate fields to "low° - high°" format

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/Graph.elm` - Orange pay segments, note annotations, Y-range
- `frontend/src/Main.elm` - Note color dropdown, weather format
- `frontend/src/Calculations.elm` - `calculateDailyPay` function with overtime
- `frontend/tests/CalculationsTest.elm` - Overtime tests, creditLimit field fix
- `pi-setup/launch-kiosk.sh` - chromium command fix
- `~/robot-config/practices-and-principles.md` - Added Makefile principle

### Principles Added

**Build Systems (Makefiles):** Every project should have a Makefile defining the canonical build/deploy process. Always use it—don't "wing it" with ad-hoc commands.

## Session 8

**Date:** 2026-01-28

### Summary

Major data model refactoring session introducing multi-job support, payCashed functionality, data migration, and x-axis redesign.

### Key Changes

**Multi-Job Support:**
- Split single `Entry` type into separate `BalanceSnapshot` and `WorkLog` types
- `BalanceSnapshot`: date, checking, creditAvailable, creditLimit, personalDebt, note
- `WorkLog`: date, jobId, hours, payRate, taxRate, payCashed
- Each job has its own work logs with independent pay rates and tax rates
- Overtime calculated per-job using Alaska rules (daily >8hrs, weekly >40hrs at 1.5x)
- Jobs managed via `Job` type with id/name, stored in `FinanceData.jobs`

**PayCashed Functionality:**
- Added `payCashed` boolean to WorkLog
- When any work log in the current week has `payCashed=true`, previous week's pay is excluded from incoming pay calculation
- Checkbox added to work log entry form

**Data Migration:**
- Created `migrate-data.sh` script to convert old Entry format to new FinanceData format
- Script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Successfully migrated Pi data (23 balance snapshots, 19 work logs)

**Color Picker UX Improvement:**
- Replaced note color radio buttons with single clickable dot
- Dot cycles through colors (none → green → blue → red → yellow → none) when clicked
- Only appears when note text is present

**X-Axis Redesign:**
- Start date fixed at Jan 4, 2026
- End date now dynamic: current day + 3 days
- Day labels split into two lines: weekday name (Mon) and day number (5)
- Three stacked sections below x-axis: weeks ("week of 1/5"), months (January), years (2026)
- Alternating background shades for visual distinction

**X-Axis Fixes:**
- Added SVG clipPath to prevent graph elements drawing outside plot area (left of Y axis)
- Added final tick mark at right edge of last day
- Increased marginBottom from 50 to 100 for stacked sections

**Pi Deployment:**
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Pi SSH info (IP: 216.152.181.254, port 2222, user: pi)
- Deploy watcher requires manual restart when not running

### Files Modified

- `backend/src/types.rs` - New BalanceSnapshot, WorkLog, Job, FinanceData types
- `backend/src/main.rs` - Separate endpoints for balance snapshots and work logs
- `frontend/src/Main.elm` - Split entry forms, payCashed checkbox, color picker UX
- `frontend/src/Calculations.elm` - Per-job overtime, payCashed logic
- `frontend/src/Graph.elm` - X-axis redesign, clipping, dynamic date range
- `frontend/src/Api/Types.elm` - Regenerated
- `migrate-data.sh` - New migration script
- `CLAUDE.md` - Pi SSH info

---

## Session 9

**Date:** 2026-01-29

### Summary

Bug fix and new feature groundwork for AI weather summaries.

### Key Changes

**Graph Bug Fix:**
- Fixed issue where days with work logs but no balance snapshot weren't showing incoming pay on the graph
- Modified `buildDayData` in `Graph.elm` to create data points for any day with either a snapshot OR a work log
- Days without a snapshot now carry forward the most recent snapshot's balance data

**Branch Cleanup:**
- Merged `multi-job-support` branch into `master` (was already deployed to Pi)
- Deleted local and remote `multi-job-support` branch

**Weather Summary Feature (In Progress):**
- Researched LLM providers for daily weather summaries
- Selected PayPerQ (ppq.ai) for anonymous usage with Bitcoin Lightning payments
- Implemented NWS data fetching in Rust backend:
  - New `/api/weather-briefing` endpoint
  - Fetches today's forecast from NWS API for Anchorage
  - Fetches active weather alerts for Anchorage zones (AKZ701, AKZ702)
- Added new types: `ForecastPeriod`, `WeatherAlert`, `WeatherBriefing`
- Added `chrono` crate for timestamps

**Status Document:**
- Created `weather-summary-status.md` documenting where the feature stands and next steps

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/Graph.elm` - Fixed buildDayData to include work-log-only days
- `backend/src/types.rs` - Added ForecastPeriod, WeatherAlert, WeatherBriefing types
- `backend/src/main.rs` - Added `/api/weather-briefing` endpoint
- `backend/src/generate_elm.rs` - Added new types to Elm generation
- `backend/Cargo.toml` - Added chrono dependency
- `weather-summary-status.md` - New status document for weather feature

### Next Steps (for future sessions)

1. Set up PayPerQ account and fund with crypto
2. Add LLM integration to backend (call PayPerQ API with weather data)
3. Display AI summary on the graph page
4. Configure scheduling (when to generate daily summary)
